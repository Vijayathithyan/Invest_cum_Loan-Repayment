    - **Strategy A**: Aggressive loan repayment. 100% of savings go to loan until fully repaid, then switch to investment.

    - **Strategy C**: Investment-first. During moratorium, invest all savings. After that, split between loan and investment.
    - **Strategy D**: Delayed aggressive repayment. Invest all savings during moratorium, then aggressively repay loan.
